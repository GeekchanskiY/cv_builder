# cv builder


### ZEN of CV Builder 
Any microservice project may be monolith, but not all the monolith apps may be microservices \
More data is predefined is better, than less \
Sometimes even the same responsibility can conflict with itself \
The more relations present in the database - the better cv you will have in result \
Abuse the system, hate HR's, be a punk!
