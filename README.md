# cv builder


### ZEN of CV Builder 
Any microservice project may be monolith, but not all the monolith apps may be microservices \
More data is predefined is better, than less \
Sometimes even the same responsibility can conflict with itself \
The more relations present in the database - the better cv you will have in result \
Abuse the system, hate HR's, be a punk! \
If skill has no domains - it can be used everywhere \
If skill has a domain - it cant be used in others \
But it still can be used in a child domains \
You can regenerate current cv, but if you want something completely new - you should re-create it \
